Each subdirectory represents a type of step in a projects' build process.
Each step is a plug-in and needs to have a compatible() method to
test whether or not the step can be automatically added and under
what circumstances based on the project, the environment, and the user's
settings.

The following are a list of the build step types in which plug-ins can be written
to carry out:

detect
    begin the process by detecting the project settings and deciding
    on the steps available to the user. Multiple detectors can be used
    on a given project
    TODO: eventually we need to differentiate between detections that are
        run only when it is certain the directory contains a project and those that
        are run on all directories, for speed concerns.
clean
    Deals with removal of past project binaries and clearing
    output directories
preprocess
    Calls sgmod and/or external preprocessors
make
    The central last minute configuration, compilation, and building
obfuscate
    Call to an obfuscator if necessary
doc
    Call to documentation generator(s)
sign
    Digitally sign code or packages as needed, based on user config
    May occur in different order, depending on whats to be signed
package
    generate packages or installers
install
    installation of packages on a local machine
test
    a placeholder for unit tests that need to be part of the build process
deploy
    any code for uploading or sending files to a particular destination
    this can be requested by the user for all built projects to be deployed
    to a sync directory like dropbox or ftp
