PURPOSE
Siege Tools is a collection of CLI developer tools designed to bring more IDE functionality back to the command line

Components
- SiegeMake (sgmake): multi-language, extensible build system wrapper
    Consists of:
        An automatic build system detector and autoconfigurer for config-less (source only) projects
        A wrapper around current systems (ant, cmake, premake, etc.) (work in progress)
        Obfuscation and digital signing support
        A cross-platform dependency resolver (to be started soon)
    Example usage:
        Programmer is supplied with a folder full of .cpp and .h source files, by running 'sgmake', the files should be crawled, dependencies should be obtained and automatically linked, and the program should go from building all the way to being able to install without any project-specific config
        Same as above but with Java, Vala, and other languages
    Notes:
        It's not supposed to be perfect in every scenario, just designed to make the best guesses based on what it can figure out about the project
        For grabbing libraries where nothing is available in package repos (like on windows), sgmake should scan for libraries on the internet (and should prompt user before downloading one, to approve of the origin site)
- SiegeTask (work in progress)
- SiegeMod (work in progress)
